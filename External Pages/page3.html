    There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not<span>.</span> Let us begin with the punctuations that are not<span>.</span> Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the <span class="words">question mark</span><span>.<sup>1</sup></span> The <span class="words">question mark</span> is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting<span>.</span> It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing<span>.</span> Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the <span class="words">question mark</span><span>.</span>
Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun<span>,</span> just an unnecessary name of something<span>.<sup>2</sup></span> A question is a question<span>,</span> anybody can know that a question  is a question and so why add to it the

<p>      <span class="words"> <a id="question" href="page4.html">question mark</a></span> when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<span>.</span> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a <span class="words">question mark</span><span>,</span> I always found it positively revolting<span>,</span> and now very few do use it<span>.</span> <span class="words">Exclamation marks</span> have the same difficulty and also <span class="words">quotation marks</span><span>,</span> they are unnecessary<span>,</span> they are ugly<span>,</span> they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use<span>,</span> if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question<span>.</span>
    The same thing is true of a quotation<span>.</span><span class="SecondLink"><sup><a href="question.html">3</a></sup></span> I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use <span class="words">question marks</span> and <span class="words">quotation marks</span> and <span class="words">exclamation points</span> and now anybody sees it that way<span>.</span>  Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<span>.</span> 
    So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious<span>,</span>  and so we do not have to go any farther into that<span>.</span>  There are <span>...</span>
