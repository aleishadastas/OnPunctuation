            holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you 
            from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to
            me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only
            now I do not pay as much attention to them<span>,</span> the use of them
            was positively degrading<span>.<sup>1</sup></span> Let me tell you what I feel and what
            I mean and what I felt and what I meant<span>.<sup>2</sup></span> When I was writing those
            long sentences of The Making of Americans<span>,</span> verbs active present
            verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me<span>.<sup><a href="comma.html">3</a></sup></span>
            I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions
            and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active
            life of writing<span>.</span> Complications make eventually for simplicity and 
            therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses<span>.</span> I have 
            like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of 
            dependence and independence<span>.</span> You can see how loving the intensity 
            of complication of

                these things that <span class="words">commas</span> would be degrading<span>.</span>
                Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive 
                complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity<span>.</span> 
                Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity<span>.<sup>4</sup></span> Do you see now why I feel about
                the <span class="words">comma</span> as I did and as I do<span>.</span> Think about anything you really like to do and 
                you will see what I mean<span>.</span> When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle
                rather than to cut the knot<span>,</span> at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread<span>,</span>
                so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence 
                or reading it after it has been written<span>.</span> And what does a <span class="words"><a id="continue" href="page8.html">comma</a></span> do<span>,</span> a <span class="words">comma</span> does nothing but
                make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the <span class="words">comma</span><span>.</span> A long 
                complicated sentence should force itself upon you<span>,</span> make you know yourself knowing it and the
