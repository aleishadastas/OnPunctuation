            <span class="words"> <a id="continue" href="page9.html">period</a></span> that lets you stop and take a breath but if 
            you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself 
            that you want to take a breath<span>.<sup>1</sup></span> It is not 
            like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, 
            but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and 
            why emphasize one breath rather than another breath<span>.</span>
             Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that 
             about it very very strongly<span>.<sup><a href="period.html">2</a></sup></span> And so I almost never used a <span class="words">comma</span><span>.</span> 
             The longer<span>,</span> the more complicated the sentence the greater the 
             number of the same kinds of words I had following one after 
             another<span>,</span> the more the very more I had of them the more I 
             felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves 
             by themselves and not helping them<span>,</span> and thereby enfeebling <span><sup>3</sup></span> 
             them by putting in a <span class="words">comma</span><span>.</span> So that is the way I felt about 
             punctuation in prose<span>,</span> in poetry it is a little different but 
             more so and later I will go into that<span>.<sup>4</sup></span>
