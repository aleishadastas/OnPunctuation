    to do with it<span>.<sup><a href="semiColon.html">1</a></sup></span> Inevitably no matter how completely 
    I had to have writing go on<span>,</span> physically one had to 
    again and again stop sometime and if one had to again 
    and again stop sometime and if one had to again and 
    again stop some time then <span class="words">periods</span> had to exist<span>.</span>  
    Beside I had always like the look of <span class="words">periods</span> and I 
    liked what they did<span>.</span>  Stopping sometime did not really 
    keep one from going on<span>,</span>  it was nothing that interfered<span>,</span>  
    it was only something that happened<span>,</span>  and as it happened as 
    a perfectly natural happening<span>,</span>  I did not believe in <span class="words">periods</span>
    and I used them<span>.<sup>2</sup></span>  I really never stopped using them<span>.</span>  
    Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own
     to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways<span>,</span>  
     that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written
    called Winning His Way<span>,</span> later I will read you a little of it<span>.</span> 
    By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods 
    had come to have for me completely a life of their own<span>.</span>

    They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt
    one<span>’</span>s writing with them that is not really interrupt one<span>’</span>s writing 
    with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in 
    one<span>’</span>s writing and so they could be used and you could use them 
    <span class="words">Periods</span> could come to exist in this way and they could come in this 
    way to have a life of their own<span>.<sup>3</sup></span> They did not serve you in any servile
     way as <span class="words">commas</span> and <span class="words">colons</span> and <span class="words"><a id="continue" href="page6.html">semi-colons</a></span> do<span>.</span> Yes you do feel what I 
     mean<span>.</span> <span class="words">Periods</span> have a life of their own a necessity of their own a 
     feeling of their own a time of their own<span>.<sup>4</sup></span> And that feeling that life
      that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety 
      that is the reason that I have always remained true to <span class="words">periods</span> so 
      much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them
       more than one had ever needed them<span>.</span> You can see what an entirely
        different thing a <span class="words">period</span> is from a <span class="words">comma</span><span>,</span> a <span class="words">colon</span> or a <span class="words">semi-colon</span><span>.</span>
