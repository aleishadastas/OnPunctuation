            different way of thinking about <span class="words">colons</span> and <span class="words">semicolons</span> you
            can think of them as <span class="words">commas</span> and as such they are purely
            servile or you can think of them as <span class="words">periods</span> and then using
            them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might
            feel about them as <span class="words">periods</span> but I myself never have<span>,</span> 
            I began unfortunately to feel them as a <span class="words">comma</span> and <span class="words">commas</span>
            are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent
            upon use and convenience and they are put there just for 
            practical purposes<span>.</span>  <span class="words">Semi-colons</span> and <span class="words"><a id="continue" href="pro4.html">colons</a></span> had for me from
            the first completely this character the character that a
            <span class="words">comma</span> has and not the character that a <span class="words">period</span> has and 
            therefore and definitely I have never used them<span>.</span>  
            But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well 
            possibly they might have in them something of the character 
            of the <span class="words">period</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them<span>.</span>  
            I really do not think so<span>.<sup>1</sup></span>  I think however lively they are
            or disguised they are they are

            definitely more <span class="words">comma</span> than <span class="words">period</span> and
            so really I cannot regret not having used them<span>.</span>  
            They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a 
            <span class="words">comma</span> but they are a <span class="words">comma</span> all the same<span>.<sup>2</sup></span>  They really have
          within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the <span class="words">comma</span> nature<span>.</span>
            And now what does a <span class="words">comma</span> do and what has it to do and why do I feel
             as I do about them<span>.<sup>3</sup></span> What does a <span class="words">comma</span> do<span>.</span>
             I have refused them so often and left the out so much 
             and did without them so continually that I have come 
             finally to be indifferent to them<span>.</span> I do not now care whether 
             you put them in or not but for a long time I felt very definitely
              about them and would have nothing to do with them<span>.</span> As I say <span class="words">commas</span> 
              are servile and they have no life of their own<span>,</span> and their use is 
              not a use<span>,</span> it is a way of replacing one<span>â€™</span>s own interest and I do 
              decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I 
              am doing<span>.<sup><a href="colon.html">4</a></sup></span> A <span class="words">comma</span> by helping you along holding<span>...</span>
