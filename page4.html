        One other little punctuation mark one can have 
        feelings about and that is the <span class="words">apostrophe</span> for possession<span>.</span>
        Well feel as you like about that<span>,</span> I can see and I do see 
        that for many that for some the possessive case <span class="words">apostrophe</span>
         has a gentle 
        tender insinuation<span><sup>2</sup></span> that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to 
        do without it<span>.</span> One does do without it<span>,</span>
        I do<span>,</span> I mostly always do<span>,</span> but I cannot deny that 
        from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put 
        it in to make the possessive case<span>.</span> I absolutely do not like it
         and leaving it out I feel no regret<span>,</span> there it is unnecessary 
         and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps<span>,</span> 
         perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness<span>.</span>
         At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if 
         it has come in and sometimes it has come in<span>.</span> I cannot

        positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in<span>.</span>
        So now to come to the real question of punctuation<span>,</span> <span class="words"> periods</span><span>,</span>
        <span class="words">commas</span><span>,</span><span class="words"> colons</span><span>,</span> <span class="words">semi-colons</span> and capitals and small letters<span>.</span>
        I have had a long and complicated life with all these<span>.<sup>3</sup></span> 
        Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are 
        colons and <span class="words">semi-colons</span><span>,</span> one might add to these <span class="words">commas</span><span>.</span>
        When I first began writing<span>,</span> I felt that writing should go on<span>,</span>
        I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began 
        writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing 
        should go on and on and if writing should go on what had <span class="words">colons</span> 
        and commas to do with it<span>,</span> what had <span class="words">periods</span> to do with it what 
        had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing 
        going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in 
        connection with writing<span>.<sup><a href="hyphen.html">4</a></sup></span> What had <span class="words">colons</span> and <span class="words">semi-colons</span> to do
         with it what had commas to do with it what had <span class="words">periods</span> to do with it<span>.</span>
         What had <span class="words">periods</span> to
